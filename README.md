# Data-Analysis-Task-1
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing the Netflix Movies & TV Shows dataset for analysis. The raw data often contains missing values, duplicates, inconsistent text, and mixed formats, which can make analysis difficult.

Key steps performed include:

-->Handling Missing Values: All rows with essential missing information, such as directors or dates, were carefully removed or filled to ensure completeness.

-->Removing Duplicates: Duplicate rows were eliminated to avoid counting the same movie or show multiple times.

-->Standardizing Text: Text fields like country names, show types, and genres were cleaned for consistency, removing extra spaces and making capitalization uniform.

-->Date Formatting: All dates were converted to a standard format for easy filtering and analysis.

-->Renaming Columns: Column names were simplified to lowercase with no spaces, making them easy to reference in code.

-->Fixing Data Types: Numeric columns like release year were converted to integers, and date fields were converted to proper datetime objects.

After these steps, the dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis or visualization. This ensures that any insights derived are accurate and reliable. The cleaned data can now be used for tasks like exploring trends, filtering by genre or country, and building visual dashboards.
